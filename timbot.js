                `cagliostro9 Last Friday at 12:15 PM: Chan we all know it‚Äôs real it‚Äôs just a good 60% of the chat doesn‚Äôt give a shit\nChandy Last Friday at 12:15 PM: Well I‚Äôm just going to have to keep explaining it until that 60% goes down to 0%`,
                `You guys act like I‚Äôm just making this shit up but it‚Äôs almost all supported by canon`,
                `I‚Äôm serious, the GBA and GBC games do an excellent job about teaching you good tennis stratagems`,
                `the GBA game is heavier on the instructional content and plot, so it's better as a self contained game. GBC is closest to N64 mechanically, but only very slightly. both are good introductions.`,
                `Wii VC is the most modern faithful release of the game. Wii U VC is more recent, but Wii U VC was significantly worse than Wii\nlaggy and bad color reproduction, like all Wii U N64 VC games`,
                `these guys really hate it when i talk about MT64 in huge walls of text, so you're always welcome to DM me if questions arise`,
                `and even then, my edited save is customized to polarize the lvl99 characters according to min/max instead of highest overall stats\nso alex is the speediest possible speedster, harry is the strongest he can possibly be etc`,
                `there would have to be a standardized stat and equipment loadout and everyone would have to download that special edited save\nthey're great for practice because you can customize them to have any set of broken stats though, so if there's a particular playstyle you struggle against you can optimize them towards that\nkind of like early amiibos in a way, since they gain EXP from being used in both games`,
                `after the top tiers, there are certain characters who can kind of hang and are soft counters on counterpick courts\nParatroopa is probably the worst character you can solo main on any court\nParatroopa, Toad, Shyguy, and Bowser are viable in certain match-ups with the right court`,
                `Waluigi is considered unviable against any speed character and baby mario and yoshi are some of the most popular, so RIP me`,
                `Mario, Luigi and the Princesses are too unspecialized to be worth using, mostly just good beginners characters`,
                `some people like to argue birdo is close to viable but she's the "technique" favored speed character so she's kind of saddled with the worst set of attributes\ni think she's the worst in the game because her niche isn't really good against anyone, but some people think speed is everything`,
                `DK runs into the same problem where he's the technique favored power character, but he's not as hopeless as birdo`,
                `the problem is that power characters get most of their mileage off the serve and early strokes so if you wanted a really good serving character with great shot placement, you'd just use boo and make up for a lack of raw power with broken serve gimmicks`,
                `playing the GBC game is actually a really good introduction to the core concepts of the meta and how it differs from IRL tennis in its unique and quirky ways`,
                `SS tier characters are wario and baby mario\nthe fastest power character and the strongest speed character, respectively\nS tier characters are boo, yoshi and DK Jr`,
                `the curse of bowser is that you're slicing all the god damn time to slow down the pace of the volley\nsince you have no mobility, you need the most time to get into a good position to anticipate a return\nso you have all the power in the world but you only really get to use it on the serve and the killstroke`,
                `i don't mean to imply that they are unga bunga, that's just a meme\nyou have to be really smart about spin choice as power characters`,
                `shy guy is sick. he's my secondary but he and waluigi play super different`,
                `i prefer technique as an archetype though, since the baits are my favorite part`,
                `honestly the secondary that would help me most is DK Jr, but i don't want to pick up an unga bunga power character`,
                `too many gimmick characters in aces\nthe two tricky characters in MT64 are very cool at top level\nshy guy should be considered a tricky character, although his gimmick is more like a core concept of his character\nrather than just a weird attribute or two like boo and paratroopa`,
                `it's a semi popular speedrunning game too, so mostly we congregate in the in the series wide mario tennis discord`,
                `they're legitimately good practice\nthey hit reactions that human players almost never do\nthat's why it's super hard to beat them at the net`,
                `it would have been a much more dominant performance if i had used the best technique character`,
                `i had to make several reads in that match\nseveral of them were unsuccessful reads too\nthe return game does not start off pretty`,
                `get overpowered on a top spin serve that forces me out of the flank, then i have to scramble back to midcourt but position myself somewhere to react to his return on the meatball i just gave him`,
                `i stopped my dash short so that i could react to the trajectory of where it would go if he had top spin smashed it, but then he hit a flat shot down the diagonal. if i had kept running i could have returned it but I had to guess\ntextbook unsuccessful read`,
                `the exact same situation happens at 2:08, and i don't cover that same angle down the diagonal\nthis time i run in that direction but decide to snake back to the left in case he goes for the mix-up and hits a straight shot down the left sideline\nagain, i guess wrong but this time i get lucky and he smashes it out of bounds`,
                `i wanted to show why waluigi conceptually struggles with speed characters`,
                `he's a max CPU on the best speed character in the entire game\nhe can read my controller inputs!!!`,

        var h = [`I was really disappointed to see everyone in the chat and the crowd at CEO yelling ‚Äúfuck hbox‚Äù. Say what you want about his character, hbox is a smart player. You don‚Äôt achieve the title of #1 by being a braindead player who sticks to one gimmick. There needs to be more respect for Hbox as a person. Right after the Axe vs. Wizzy grand finals at Smash Summit 8, when Hbox presented Axe the 1st place award, Hbox begins a heartfelt speech to Axe by saying ‚Äúyou know, I won this award last summit..‚Äù and starts breaking up. Immediately, Twitch chat starts saying ‚Äúwow typical hungrybox making it all about himself.‚Äù Its absolutely amazing how everyone automatically assumes the worst and has never bothered to give the benefit of the doubt. If you go back and read /u/iamhungrybox comment on the Mango ama from 5 years ago, it‚Äôs really very awful how he‚Äôs been vilified in the community. Reminds me of Ken when he decided he wanted to retire. Everyone was rooting against him because he was the best, and he couldn‚Äôt handle the pressure. It‚Äôd be a fucking shame to see a talent like Hbox do the same. \nHbox if you see this, you‚Äôre fuckin sick at melee. Play the game for as long as you want to, but never feel pressured to keep going if its unhealthy. The internet and these communities suck ass when it comes to recognizing the pressure people in your position are in and the shit you‚Äôve had to endure to get to where you are. \nYou‚Äôre great, man. Keep it up, proud of you.`,

Like suck my fucking dick if you think - no, honest to god - if you think, if you think, if you think, if you ever complain, if you're a Fox player and you ever complain about Puff, you need to reevaluate where you fucking stand. Because like, come on dude. That shit is not easy. Are you kidding me? I die from a grab up-throw up-air at like what, 45 on Yoshi's? If I land a rest on a platform, on a side-platform, at 32 percent I'm fucking dead? And people are giving me shit? Come on now, dude. No! No dude. I just got like wobbled. If you're gonna play this character with this infuriating infinite and I'm so done with ICs, oh dude, I just want, I hope every single game from here on out goes to 8 minutes. I hope every single time. And I'll taunt the fuck out of Sopo, every single time. I'm just, I'm so done with it, you know.`,
                `Fuck this community man. All you guys ever do is look for ways to give me shit over any tiny thing.

                `For being the best player in the world, you're pretty immature. I think it's dumb you didn't even shake my hand after I beat you at NCR or even opt to take a picture with me and PPU for the results thread. \nMaybe I'm just bitter that you single-handedly turned an entire community against me and used your popularity to defame me and give people a completely wrong idea of me. It's weird that people on facebook still message me saying, "Dude you're actually a really nice person, everyone told me you were an asshole or something lawl". \nNow you've got the community in an even greater hold with your cult-esque fervor we call Mango Nation. You're the only person who can literally ride his own dick and people encourage you even more when you do it. If I was to even say a tenth of the self-promoting claims you make online, I'd have a brigade of hate lined up on top of the massive amount I already do. \nI don't have to go into how you treated me when I housed you and picked you up from the airport and the degrading and disgusting stuff you did and said about my mom. You think I don't remember? Not to mention saying similar things about my now ex-girlfriend. I really wanted to sock you in the fucking face so many times. \nBut I wouldn't stoop to that level. \nThe reality is, and the worst part is, that I have too much respect for you as a player. You've taken my favorite game and past-time to new levels and you constantly awe me with your advancing of the Melee meta-game. It keeps me on my feet and encourages me and countless others to keep playing. Everyone knows that, and no one can take that away from you.`,
                `I have applauded your victories at EVERY tournament we've both been at. Every last once. I've shaken your hand and applauded you even after our sets. Even after Genesis 2, when you taunted me Game 3 as you were approaching a 4-stock on me. Even EVO, with the world watching. I took the approach of the bigger man, in hopes that maybe it would inspire you to do the same. And I was very wrong. \nThe thing is, now that the entire fighting game community knows of you, you have all the leverage you need to get your points across. You're the end-all for knowledge of the game and community. \nYou've gotten better about your attitude towards me, at least subtly. With Armada retired and with our tournament records in full display, I'm ranked #2 or #3 in the world behind you. Even still, you make it seem like I'm a joke for ever playing this game. \nAll I'd like is for you to just stop this nonsense and have at least an ounce of sportsmanship towards me. It's the least you could do after some of the things you've put me through that I won't mention. And don't just label off your actions as jokes. Yeah, you're a funny guy. But it's not nice being on the end of the stick for four years. \nMan up and be the representative this community actually needs.`,

                `Also this whole "ban wobbling" argument, w-when's the last time ICs won a supernational? I-I'lll wait. I can't think of one actually. It's weird that we wanna ban the 8th best character's number 1 tool to actually win, it's kind of strange to me. No-one likes getting wobbled - I hate getting wobbled, but if you are that salty that where everytime you get wobbled, if- every time you get wobbled, maybe don't get grabbed, don't get set up, maybe just get good for once in your life and actually stop blaming the fucking character.`,
                `I'll tell the story. I was just a fan who was excited to meet and challenge Hbox to a $5 puff ditto best of 5 on dreamland. In the middle of game 1 he punched me in the liver and walked off with my wallet and JP White controller. Now I have to play melee through a straw.`,

                `I saw Hungrybox at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. \nHe said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù \nI was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. \nThe girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. \nWhen she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.`,

I was still in shock from seeing him, but I try and strike up a conversation while he waits for his food. \"S- so, how do you feel about Chick-Fil-A and the gay rights controversy.\" He turns to me and says \"motherfucker, I come here BECAUSE I hate the gays!\" I'm stunned as the cashier brings Hbox his food.

                `Every single tournament Hbox wins, I always immediately check these threads to read every angry post. It's like crack to me. I can not get enough of this. \nIt's like you people don't realise just how amazing HungryBox really is at this game. \nYou are so simple-minded that you can't fathom that ''muh tech skill'' isn't all that Melee has to offer. Hbox has a deeper understanding of the game than any other player. His spacing and mindgames are simply off the chart when it comes to pure depth. \nAll these people playing literally the most OP character in the game can't do shit against Hbox's smart play. He's literally picking all of them apart and doing so much mental damage that they start second doubting themselves and throwing games. That's some powerful play. \nI love watching Melee. Not only do I get to see my all-time favourite player destroy everyone, but I also get to see you faggots bitch and whine about what's essentially a mid tier. Keep crying though, but it won't change anything. \nGood games, Hbox! Will be rooting for you next time as well. Not that you'll need it. Wouldn't expect anything less from the #1 ranked Melee player!`,
                `And this weekend a miracle happened. I sat down to play Armada, I blinked, and my goal was suddenly behind me. A glass trophy in my hand with the official title written on it. Cameras flashing. Overwhelming emotion, disbelief, euphoria, and relief. Out of nowhere I played the best I have in my life while coming from losers. \nThe outpouring of congratulations I received was more than I ever would have imagined. It was a very beautiful experience to get to have that. And for that I'm very thankful. \nHowever, as expected there were some communities that don't see eye to eye on things. Like this subreddit, half of CFL Melee (my home community), and many others. And that's alright. That's reality. \nI'll never really understand why certain people don't realize what I put into this game. It might be the character I play. It might be my polarizing personality. But what I've learned is that you really can't focus on these things if you want to win. When I was on that stage I fell in love with Melee all over again. Just like I did when I attended my first very tournament in Florida and got 2nd to last place out of 40. \nI've had very difficult times reading things on this subreddit about me, but after this weekend I'm ready to move on from it. I proved to the world what I wanted to prove. I know I won't be able to change minds now or ever of that many people. But I respect your opinions and I encourage you to have them. I simply think it would be healthier for me to distance myself from it to continue performing at the level I want to. \nKeep playing Melee, keep cheering on your favorite player. Just love this game always. It's the best thing that's happened to me in a lot of ways, and I hope it's the same for you. \n-hungrybox`,
                `Every time Hbox pulls through, and he does every time, I always make sure to check these threads immediately. You virgins are the source of some premium salt. \n \nKeep in mind that Hbox is playing Jigglypuff, essentially a mid tier character, in a meta where 50% of all top 100 players are maining Fox, which is Puff's absolutely worst MU sitting at 70-30 in Fox's favour. You're all just fucking scrubs who can't accept that HungryBox is the single best player to ever have touched a GC controller. This is undeniable facts at this point. \n \nNo one else has managed to prove again and again that my skill reigns supreme. Year after year of consistent wins over every single opponent. Taking tourney after tourney. \n \nStay mad, bitches. He'll keep winning.`,
                `Hello /r/ssbm, \n \n I've read many, many, many things on this subreddit. A lot of them make me wonder about the backgrounds you all have had in competitive melee. My assumption is that most of you have at least attended/participated in one tournament and that you know a good bit about the history of the game. \n \nIf you have competed in the game, you're aware of what it's like to be in a hot seat. To have to think on the spot, adapt on the fly, cope with horrible losses, deal with salt, etc. \n \nMost of you (I think) understand what Melee is at its core. A phenomenal, unfathomably deep fighting game unlike any that's been created. It's why we love it and analyze it and have it as our passion. \n \nI've been competing for 10 years now. A lot of things have changed in this community. We almost didn't exist at one point when Brawl came out. We all had to pull a lot of weight to make sure we weren't forgotten and it's beautiful to see where we've gotten today. \n \nOnce Melee became a thriving, living community again it was a good time for me to focus on my own gameplay and not just the growth of the community. From 2013 to 2016 was probably my biggest era of growth both as a person maturing and as a Melee player. I obtained some much-needed discipline and learned more about myself from every event I attended. \n \nI yearned for the World Title. A massive goal for myself. And goals are something everyone here has - whether it's in Melee or outside of it. So I did everything I could to obtain that goal as soon as possible. I prioritized Melee for a summer, I got my best friend to be a sponsored coach for me, I became active in the Netplay community; Hell, I even took any chance to spread memes or information on social media about Smash. Because I love the community and I love what its given me.`,
                `You know what, I admit it: I don't like HBox. At a fundamental level, I know it's not rational, but let me tell you what I do know: I don't like it when his slow, broken character dunks on my favorite players and kills my excitement. I don't like it when he grandstands during interviews and looks so fake and disingenuous. I don't like it when I have to watch everything I find awesome about this game get back-aired off stage or up-tilt rested time an time again until I don't feel anything anymore`,
                `Yeah hfam we did it XD I'm literally DABBING on ALL the hbox haters in chat with my HFam right now LOL!`,
                `Juan wakes up at 5:43 AM, before his morning alarm, ready to begin his typical Saturday morning ritual. Crunch is still asleep in the bed next to him, his body still warm where they touched. Juan violently shakes him awake yelling "LET'S FUCKING GO! IT'S TIME!" Crunch sluggishly rolls out of bed and says "Let... let me at least get ready first." Juan sits pouting on the edge of the bed while his coach uses the restroom, he hears a faint "What am I doing with my life...?" behind the closed door, but decides to ignore it.\n\nCrunch returns, and turns on the TV. Juan perks up, giddy with excitement. His adviser fumbles through loading up a PowerPoint presentation, but after a few minutes he's finally prepared. "Ready to start, Juan?" he says, and the answer is obvious. The first picture comes on the screen, a tweet from Mang0 at 2:23 AM the previous night.\n\n> got too wasted, not playing tomorrow\n> \n> good luck big leff\n> \n> ROFL\n> \n> GO EAGLES\n\n"FUUUUCK YEEEESSSS!" comes the inevitable scream from Juan, surely waking up the people in the neighboring hotel rooms. "FUCK THAT STUPID DRUNK IDIOT, NOW HIS FANS WI-"\n\n"Hooold up" Crunch cuts him off, "don't get carried away, there's more." Juan stares at the TV silently, his hands in a praying position. Crunch flips over to the next image. It's from Leffen.\n\n> feeling too sick to play, but might as well enter ultimate\n> \n> I'm tired of lying to you guys, the game is just easier. I'll definitely play melee at the next one, I promise.\n\n"YEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS!!! FUCKING FUCK!!!!!" Juan shouts, tears coming to his eyes. "THEY HAVE TO GIVE ME #1 NOW! Tell me they'll give it to me again, Crunch."\n\n"Well, we'll have to wait and see. It's likely." Crunch replies, already afraid of Juan's response.\n\n"What do you mean wait and see? Who can stop me now? This is the most important tournament left! I'll have too many wins!" Juan is talking more quickly, becoming pink in the face like his signature character. Crunch just silently looks at him, and goes to the final picture. It's Zain's twitter.\n\n> Feeling great, see you guys tomorrow!\n\nJuan instinctively, almost preemptively lunges forward off the bed and brings both his fists down, smashing the TV. "Aw, come on man, not again..." comes a voice from the doorway. It's The Crimson Blur.`];
