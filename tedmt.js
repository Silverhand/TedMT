                `but if you give bowser the opportunity to move forward, he will just dismantle you at the net. all of the power characters have great reach but bowser is the second tallest character in the game, so getting around him if he manages to push up on the net is near impossible`,
                `if you don't constantly keep them moving around the court, they can set their feet and charge unreturnable smashes. it's much easier to do that if you're not on the backstep though, so you might be tempted to slice a lot to give yourself more time to recover and get back in the center of the court`,
                `even his medium strength shots have so much power that you can never be sure how to return them\nyour best bet is to play conservatively and that requires a technique character with mobility (like waluigi)\nbut more likely toad or shyguy in the current meta\nif the power character catches you out of position, it's really hard to take control of the pace of the volley from them`,

                `on a weak bounce court, this won't have as much of an impact, but on any other court,  you have to be super careful about how you receive a power character's topspin`,
                `this makes them very risky to return on courts with high bounce. bowser can hit a chance ball that looks like a perfect meatball jammed lob ("chance ball"), but lands with absurd spin.`,
                `in practice, this graphical quirk is mostly helpful for the extremely powerful characters on the cast\nbowser has to really swing on a fool to get a power trail, so a lot of his topspin volleys won't get a trail even though they're still travelling and spinning extremely fast`,
